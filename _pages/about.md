I believe that math should be made as clear and intuitive as possible. I love showing how it can be made concrete, and how it applies to the real world.

I especially enjoy making hands on interactive math games. Some examples are below.

Teaching angles as a space invaders game: ![](/images/radians.gif)

Roots and intercepts of polynomials as a snake game: ![](/images/snake.gif)

Interactive geometry to explore what stays invariant. The midpoints of the quadrilateral always form a parallelogram: ![](/images/parallelogram.gif)
